In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" I believe he goes from a calm mood to a proud mood. He starts off describing his life so far and family. How he used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba and how his family lives in Newark, New Jersey along with other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immagrints. Then he talks about the neighborhood and how together are great solidarity and friendships. Also, a honest and hard working community mostly immagrints. He also said, "I will always be grateful to my for their love and sacrifice." (paragraph @NUM1) I think Narciso feel thankful and proud to be a Cuban and have such wonderful parents. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." (last sentence)
