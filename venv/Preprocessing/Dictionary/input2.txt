The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad.
For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he "Passionate Cuban music
(which I adore to this day)". "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary
skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).
In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile.
And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community "It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants
who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need." And Narciso also said
"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music
but life and love."
The man, knowing it was late, hurried home.
Jill, who is my sister, shut the door.
